    <li>Lightly beat the egg and golden syrup together in a separate bowl, then add to the other mixture.</li>
    <li>Mix/blend well until the mixture clumps together to form a dough, then knead until smooth.</li>
    <li>Wrap the dough in cling film and leave to chill in the fridge for 15 minutes</li>
