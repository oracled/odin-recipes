    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A go-to british teatime treat, these scones are quick and easy to make and will go great with just about everything. Your scones should be soft and fluffy with a golden top!</p>
    <br>
    <h2><ul>Ingredients (Makes 8):</h2></ul>
   <li>350g self-raising flour, plus more for dusting</li>
   <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
   <li>85g butter, cubed</li>
   <li>3 tbsp caster sugar</li>
   <li>175ml milk</li>
   <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
   <li>lemon juice</li>
   <li>beaten egg, to glaze</li>
   <li>jam and clotted cream <em>(optional)</em></li>
   <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    <br>
    <ol><h2>Steps:</h2>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 220/200c Fan/Gas 7.</li>
    <li>Pour the self-raising flour into a large bowl with 1/4 tsp salt and the baking powder, then mix.</li>
    <li>Add the butter, then rub in with your fingers until the mix looks like fine crumbs.</li>
    <li>Stir in the caster sugar</li>
    <li>Put the milk into a jug and heat in the microwave for about 30 secs until warm, but not hot. Add the vanilla extract and a squeeze of lemon juice to the milk.</li>
    <li>Put a prepare baking tray in the oven</li>
<li>Make a well in the scone mix, then add the liquid and combine quickly with a knife until a dough is formed.</li>
<li>Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface, and then lightly flour your hands and the dough. Fold the dough over 2-3 times until smooth, then pat into a round about 4cm deep.</li>
<li>Dip a 5cm round cutter into flour, plunge into the dough, then repeat until you have eight scones. You may need to squish the dough into another round to get all eight.</li>
<li>Brush the tops with a beaten egg, then carefully arrange on the hot baking tray, and bake for 10 minutes or until risen and golden.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'd recommend eating them warm or cold on the day of baking, topped with jam and clotted cream (if thats your style).</p>
